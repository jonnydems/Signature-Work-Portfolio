<h3> RESTful web server for St. Paul crime data </h3>

The first project is a RESTful web server for St. Paul crime data. This project also includes an about page for the developers, and a number of API routes relating to the data. This website is helpful for comparing different crime rates and types of crime for areas of Saint Paul. For example, downtown Saint Paul saw the most crimes in total for the time range, but certain areas such as the Payne-Phalen neighborhood saw a higher rate of violent crimes.

<h3> 3D Shading and Illumination </h3>

The second project implements the standard computer graphics illumination model using HTML's WebGL2 API via the Babylon.js Framework. This project includes 3 scenes that have multiple 3 dimensional objects with different lighting and textures. In addition to this, the scenes also have a heigh displacement setting, Gouraud and Phong shading, and multiple light sources that can be moved.

<h3> Generative landscape for guitar </h3>

The third project is a generative landscape that responds in real time to the volume and frequency of a guitar being played through the computer. This project uses p5js to create a visual experience that reflects the song being played. The scene will start out as a mountain landscape and will change colors, brightness, and objects based off of the frequencies.
