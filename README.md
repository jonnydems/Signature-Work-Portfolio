<h3> RESTful web server for St. Paul crime data </h3>

The first project is a RESTful web server for St. Paul crime data and can be found at https://github.com/catherinekieffer/catherinekieffer.github.io. This project also includes an about page for the developers, and a number of API routes relating to the data. This website is helpful for comparing different crime rates and types of crime for areas of Saint Paul. For example, downtown Saint Paul saw the most crimes in total for the time range, but certain areas such as the Payne-Phalen neighborhood saw a higher rate of violent crimes.
